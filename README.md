# new sdl project

I've had a fun time working in C++ and using libsdl2, so I am going to provide a template for quick starting new projects.

This project is set up similar to [ecs](https://github.com/mikedesu/ecs).

Clone the repo locally, `cd` into the cloned folder, and run `./build.sh` to compile the project.
